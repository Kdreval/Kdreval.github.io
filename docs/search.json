Separately, &gt; 100k variants from additional set of 470 patients were analyzed as independent testing set to validate the deveoped classifier.\nBurkitt lymphoma (BL) accounts for most pediatric non-Hodgkin lymphomas, being less common but significantly more lethal when diagnosed in adults. Much of the knowledge of the genetics of BL thus far has originated from the study of pediatric BL (pBL), leaving its relationship to adult BL (aBL) and other adult lymphomas not fully explored. We sought to more thoroughly identify the somatic changes that underlie lymphomagenesis in aBL and any molecular features that associate with clinical disparities within and between pBL and aBL.\nThrough comprehensive whole-genome sequencing of 230 BL and 295 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) tumors, we identified additional significantly mutated genes, including more genetic features that associate with tumor Epstein-Barr virus status, and unraveled new distinct subgroupings within BL and DLBCL with 3 predominantly comprising BLs: DGG-BL (DDX3X, GNA13, and GNAI2), IC-BL (ID3 and CCND3), and Q53-BL (quiet TP53). Each BL subgroup is characterized by combinations of common driver and noncoding mutations caused by aberrant somatic hypermutation. The largest subgroups of BL cases, IC-BL and DGG-BL, are further characterized by distinct biological and gene expression differences. IC-BL and DGG-BL and their prototypical genetic features (ID3 and TP53) had significant associations with patient outcomes that were different among aBL and pBL cohorts.\nThese findings highlight shared pathogenesis between aBL and pBL, and establish genetic subtypes within BL that serve to delineate tumors with distinct molecular features, providing a new framework for epidemiologic, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies.\nHow to cite:\nThomas N, Dreval K, Gerhard DS, Hilton LK, Abramson JS, Ambinder RF, Barta S, Bartlett NL, Bethony J, Bhatia K, Bowen J.

Using machine learning techiques, we have further developed classifier to assign new cases into one of the discovered genetic subgroups, and validated it using 2 independent validation cohorts collectively comprising ~ 750 patients.\nFollicular lymphoma (FL) accounts for ‚àº20% of all new lymphoma cases. Increases in cytological grade are a feature of the clinical progression of this malignancy, and eventual histologic transformation (HT) to the aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) occurs in up to 15% of patients. Clinical or genetic features to predict the risk and timing of HT have not been described comprehensively.\nIn this study, we analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 423 patients to compare the protein coding and noncoding mutation landscapes of untransformed FL, transformed FL, and de novo DLBCL. This revealed 2 genetically distinct subgroups of FL, which we have named DLBCL-like (dFL) and constrained FL (cFL). Each subgroup has distinguishing mutational patterns, aberrant somatic hypermutation rates, and biological and clinical characteristics. We implemented a machine learning-derived classification approach to stratify patients with FL into cFL and dFL subgroups based on their genomic features. Using separate validation cohorts, we demonstrate that cFL status, whether assigned with this full classifier or a single-gene approximation, is associated with a reduced rate of HT. This implies distinct biological features of cFL that constrain its evolution, and we highlight the potential for this classification to predict HT from genetic features present at diagnosis.\nHow to cite:\nDreval K, Hilton LK, Cruz M, Shaalan H, Ben-Neriah S, Boyle M, Collinge B, Coyle KM, Duns G, Farinha P, Grande BM.

It is based on operating the data using polars, which greatly increases run times on large datasets. The simple convenience wrapper functions will optionally take the pre-loaded input data, generate individual files, run sigprofiler, calculate relative exposure and perform cleanup. Optionally, the panel-based subsetting will also be performed on-the-fly increasing user experience, practicality, and real-world workflows. lymphgenerator module can also perform stat comparisons and visualizations.\nThis project is under development and more information will come with the publication of the manuscript.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out more projects:\n\n \n\n\n\n                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

The exponential growth in genomic data from advanced sequencing technologies requires avialability of efficient, scalable, and reproducible bioinformatics pipelines. As part of Lymphoid Cancer Research Department team at the BC Cancer, I contributed to the development of the Lymphoid Cancer Research modules (LCR-modules), a suite of open-source bioinformatics tools designed to leverage diverse genomic data types, including whole genome, exome, and long-read sequencing. Built on the Snakemake workflow management system, LCR-modules offers a versatile toolkit for processing and analyzing large genomic datasets. The suite comprises 49 workflows organized into three levels, facilitating tasks from low-level quality control to complex cohort-level analyses. LCR-modules supports various sequencing types and integrates features like mutation calling, gene expression analysis, and data aggregation, ensuring flexibility and reproducibility.
