    "text": "GAMBLR.data: R package with a collection of genomic data\n GAMBLR.data is an open-source portable R library.  If you‚Äôve had issues with importing genomic data from large-scale lymphoma studies, need to work with standardized data used for analysis of somatic variants, find yourself translating between different genome build systems, or just want a great great comprehensive resource of genomic data in B-cell lymphomas, GAMBLR.data is for you.  Alongside the genomic data, the package also contains a set of functions providing an API to easily retreive and operate on this data in a reproducible fashion.  The package is set up to be maintained through GitHub Actions, which ensures that it can be correctly installed in a new environment.  The package has associated detailed documentation carefully crafted in an interactive manner, also containing tutorials and FAQ. Check it out!  GAMBLR stands for Genomic Analysis of Mature B-cell Lymphomas in R, and is part of the family of R packages for lymphoma cancer research developed in the Morin Lab at the Simon Fraser University.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
