    "text": "GAMBLR.data: R package with a collection of genomic data\n GAMBLR.data is an open-source portable R library.  If you‚Äôve had issues with importing genomic data from large-scale lymphoma studies, need to work with standardized data used for analysis of somatic variants, find yourself translating between different genome build systems, or just want a great great comprehensive resource of genomic data in B-cell lymphomas, GAMBLR.data is for you.  Alongside the genomic data, the package also contains a set of functions providing an API to easily retreive and operate on this data in a reproducible fashion.  The package is set up to be maintained through GitHub Actions, which ensures that it can be correctly installed in a new environment.  The package has associated detailed documentation carefully crafted in an interactive manner, also containing tutorials and FAQ. Check it out!  GAMBLR stands for Genomic Analysis of Mature B-cell Lymphomas in R, and is part of the family of R packages for lymphoma cancer research developed in the Morin Lab at the Simon Fraser University.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Follicular lymphoma classifier\n\nPublished in the leading journal of hematology research, Blood, this study leveraged &gt; 130k variants from 423 patients to discover genetic subgroups within follicular lymphoma (FL) with clinically relevant distinct features. Using machine learning techiques, we have further developed classifier to assign new cases into one of the discovered genetic subgroups, and validated it using 2 independent validation cohorts collectively comprising ~ 750 patients.\nFollicular lymphoma (FL) accounts for ‚àº20% of all new lymphoma cases. Increases in cytological grade are a feature of the clinical progression of this malignancy, and eventual histologic transformation (HT) to the aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) occurs in up to 15% of patients. Clinical or genetic features to predict the risk and timing of HT have not been described comprehensively.\nIn this study, we analyzed whole-genome sequencing data from 423 patients to compare the protein coding and noncoding mutation landscapes of untransformed FL, transformed FL, and de novo DLBCL. This revealed 2 genetically distinct subgroups of FL, which we have named DLBCL-like (dFL) and constrained FL (cFL). Each subgroup has distinguishing mutational patterns, aberrant somatic hypermutation rates, and biological and clinical characteristics. We implemented a machine learning-derived classification approach to stratify patients with FL into cFL and dFL subgroups based on their genomic features. Using separate validation cohorts, we demonstrate that cFL status, whether assigned with this full classifier or a single-gene approximation, is associated with a reduced rate of HT. This implies distinct biological features of cFL that constrain its evolution, and we highlight the potential for this classification to predict HT from genetic features present at diagnosis.\nHow to cite:\nDreval K, Hilton LK, Cruz M, Shaalan H, Ben-Neriah S, Boyle M, Collinge B, Coyle KM, Duns G, Farinha P, Grande BM.

    "text": "LCR-modules: reproducible workflows to analyze massive genomic datasets\n LCR-modules is a collection of standard analytical modules for genomic and transcriptomic data. Too often do we copy-paste from each other‚Äôs pipelines, which has several pitfalls. Fortunately, all of these problems can be solved with standardized analytical modules, and the benefits are many.  The exponential growth in genomic data from advanced sequencing technologies requires avialability of efficient, scalable, and reproducible bioinformatics pipelines. As part of Lymphoid Cancer Research Department team at the BC Cancer, I contributed to the development of the Lymphoid Cancer Research modules (LCR-modules), a suite of open-source bioinformatics tools designed to leverage diverse genomic data types, including whole genome, exome, and long-read sequencing. Built on the Snakemake workflow management system, LCR-modules offers a versatile toolkit for processing and analyzing large genomic datasets. The suite comprises 49 workflows organized into three levels, facilitating tasks from low-level quality control to complex cohort-level analyses. LCR-modules supports various sequencing types and integrates features like mutation calling, gene expression analysis, and data aggregation, ensuring flexibility and reproducibility. Available at https://github.com/LCR-BCCRC/lcr-modules, LCR-modules represents a significant advancement in genomic data analysis, addressing key challenges in reproducibility and scalability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
