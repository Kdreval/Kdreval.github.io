<div style="text-align: justify">
Hi! :wave:
<br/>
I am the Staff Scientist I at the Morin Lab at the Canada's Michael Smith Genome Sciences Centre in beautiful Vancouver, BC, Canada. My daily routine includes software engineering, analysis of datasets ranging from hundreds to tens of millions, and development and optimization of machine learning models to uncover hidden patterns in the data invisible to  human eye.
<br/>
I am originally from Ukraine, but have travelled the world since 2014 and gained experience working in both government and academia settings across 2 continents. Now I live in Vancouver area of beautiful BC, Canada. :bear:
