# MAFKleanup: machine learning algorithm to remove noise from variant calls

<br><br>

This project is focused on developing machine learning model that laverages > 38 M variants to develop algorithm to clean uninformative variants from the outputs of variant calling tools.

This project is under development and more information will come with the publication of the manuscript.
