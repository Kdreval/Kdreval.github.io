# GAMBLR.data: R package with a collection of genomic data

<br><br>
[GAMBLR.data](https://github.com/morinlab/GAMBLR.data) is an open-source portable R library.
<br><br>
If you've had issues with importing genomic data from large-scale lymphoma
studies, need to work with standardized data used for analysis of somatic
variants, find yourself translating between different genome build systems,
or just want a great great comprehensive resource of genomic data in B-cell
lymphomas, GAMBLR.data is for you.
<br><br>
Alongside the genomic data, the package also contains a set of functions providing an API to easily retreive and operate on this data in a reproducible fashion.
<br><br>
The package is set up to be maintained through GitHub Actions, which ensures that it can be correctly installed in a new environment.
<br><br>
The package has associated detailed documentation carefully crafted in an interactive manner, also containing tutorials and FAQ. [Check it out!](https://morinlab.github.io/GAMBLR.data/)
<br><br>
GAMBLR stands for **G**enomic **A**nalysis of **M**ature **B**-cell **L**ymphomas
in **R**, and is part of the family of R packages for lymphoma cancer research
developed in the [Morin Lab](https://morinlab.github.io/) at the Simon Fraser
University.
