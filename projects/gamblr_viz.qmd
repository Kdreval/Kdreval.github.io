# GAMBLR.viz: R package to visualize genomic datasets

<br><br>
[GAMBLR.viz](https://github.com/morinlab/GAMBLR.viz) is an open-source portable R library.
<br><br>
If you dream of generating oncoplot with great flexibility of annotations but don’t have enough time or skill to look at ComplexHeatmap, need to have a simple function to look at hypermutated regions from birds-eye view or under microscope but don’t know how to approach this, or if you find yourself always struggling to adjust your code for simple comparison of mutation frequency between two groups, GAMBLR.viz is for you!
<br><br>
The package is set up to be maintained through GitHub Actions, which ensures that it can be reproducibly installed in a new environment.
<br><br>
The package has associated detailed documentation carefully crafted in an interactive manner, also containing a number of tutorials, FAQ, and other resources. [Check it out!](https://morinlab.github.io/GAMBLR.viz/)
<br><br>
GAMBLR stands for **G**enomic **A**nalysis of **M**ature **B**-cell **L**ymphomas
in **R**, and is part of the family of R packages for lymphoma cancer research
developed in the [Morin Lab](https://morinlab.github.io/) at the Simon Fraser
University.
